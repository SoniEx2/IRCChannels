Channel Rules for Life
======================

There are 3 main rules:

1. Respect everyone.
2. Accept and support everyone until they harm others.
3. Get others to follow this.

###Examples:

Bad:

> \<A\> Please don't call me a bitch.  
> \<B\> I'll call you whatever I want, bitch.

Good:

> \<A\> Please don't call her that.  
> \<B\> You don't get to say that. She told me she's fine with it.

Bad:
> \<P\> He's a pedo, kill him!

Good:
> \<P\> He's a pedo but he has never harmed anyone so I'm ok with him.
